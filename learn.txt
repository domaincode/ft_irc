setsockopt =====> function; TCP_NODELAY  :Enabling TCP_NODELAY (TCP_NODELAY): 
Disables the Nagle algorithm for TCP sockets, 
which can reduce latency in certain scenarios by 
sending smaller packets immediately instead of waiting to accumulate more data.



WARNING: select() can monitor only file descriptors numbers that
       are less than FD_SETSIZE 1024


int poll(struct pollfd *fds, nfds_t nfds, int timeout);

fds → pointer to an array of struct pollfd (the fds you want to watch)

nfds → number of elements in fds array

timeout → milliseconds to wait:

-1 → wait forever

0 → non-blocking, just check and return

>0 → wait up to that many milliseconds

returns: number of fds with events, 0 if timeout, -1 on error.
